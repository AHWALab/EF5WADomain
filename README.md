# EF5 West Africa Domain

Configuration of EF5 computational domain for West Africa. This repository includes all basic files (DEM and its derivatives), parameters for CREST and Kinematic Wave models, and control file to run simulations over selected basins in West Africa.

## Contents

1) Parameters for CREST and Kinematic Wave models were estimated using the a-priori estimation methods described in Vergara et al. (2016) and Clark et al. (2017).

2) Includes climatological estimates of Potential EvapoTranspiration (PET) from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and a sample of IMERG Early Run Version 6 precipitation estimates.

3) Pre-computed outputs from a simulation based on this set-up are included.

4) Shapefile of countries included in the EF5 domain and raster with a mask of major basins.
